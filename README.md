# EyeTracking
As of now, it opens dummy.mp4 as a screen capture video file and camera to start capturing.

to run:
if you want both eye coordinates in the camera capture run- python VC_EyeCoordinates.py
and without eye coordinates: python videoCapture.py


Output:
for python VC_EyeCoordinates.py two mp4 files are generated:
video_output1.mp4 frame by frame the captured video/screen state
camera_output1.mp4 frame by frame the captured face with eye movements state

for python videoCapture.py two mp4 files are generated:
video_output.mp4 frame by frame the captured video/screen state
camera_output.mp4 frame by frame the captured face state
